As a career enthusiast, I am a software engineer having experience of 2 years in PHP open
source projects like wordpress, laravel and drupal. Also I have solid working experience in
angular js and jekyll , I think these are my added advantages. Besides that I know a lot of
technologies like GIT, SASS,Bash, Golang,....

As a person, I am very interested to learn new things and apply that changes in everyday life. I
am a very happy person and having a lot of good characters. Also I am very happy to help and
teach novel things to friends, so I implement a win - win policy. I can learn more, and my friends
too learn with me.

Now, I am sure, I am one of the best employees in the current company, I learned a lot of
things- how to code for industry? ,how to manage the time? , how to manage the project?..
And more. I would like to explore more, change my thoughtâ€™s altitude high and dream big
