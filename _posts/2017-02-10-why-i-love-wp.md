I am a php developer specialised in content management systems, mostly WordPress, drupal and Jekyll. I am not very much expert as others, with in the short experience of two years, I did some very good projects in PHP open source CMSs as well as Githubâ€™s jekyll. Among these, I love WordPress very much and I strongly advise to learn WordPress if you will like to work with a strong CMS or make a business based on CMS.

##Before going to deep, let us look what is a CMS?

Content management Systems simply we called CMS, is actually a tool that used to make a beautiful site or a blog with limited or no coding. Your hand become clean and you can make a nice looking site! No need to change or add the HTML, CSS, JS etc for adding new content, new post, new feed and more. You want to know a little bit about the CMS concepts.

So comes to Wordpress, it is a free and opensource CMS platform in PHP. Thanks to Matt Mullenweg, the creator of WordPress for this super easy tool. Now, on the world wide web, more than 26.4%, is created by Wordpress!

##Why wordpress become so popular?

The main credits go to themes, plugins and simplicity of the admin panel. There are thousands of free themes and plugins available for Wordpress. The theme is used to change the appearance of the site, like how the header and footer will show, how the menu will show and more. Each and every part of the WordPress site is customizable,

Plugins are some packages or collection of files that increase the functionality of the WordPress. Simply WordPress can post pages, post etc with some simple features like a featured image, comment box etc. But we can use plugins for extending the functionality- whatever we needed. If we want to create a shopping cart, use woo-commerce. Then we want to make a social media, use BuddyPress. If we need multilanguage just use WPML or qTranslate and more...

Wordpress admin panel is very simple, clean and anybody can understand each menu at a single glance. Unlike Joomla and drupal, I confused what I had to do next when I saw them first. A lot of menus, sub-menus. I don't like that!

The second thing is simple coding. If we know the basic PHP and MySQL, we can easily learn how to create a custom theme in WordPress, how to create simple plugins, how to create a custom component like custom posts, meta boxes, custom taxonomies etc. Also, WordPress provide a good codex- a simple as well as wide documentation, there we can find everything, every update and more examples, Ultimately there are a lot of blogs that will help you to learn WordPress

I found difficulties when I started to learn drupal. I found the answers only in their forum, and some of them are not completed, and little confusing. Also, the major issue with drupal is, when their major version changes, that means from 6.x.x to 7.x.x. And to 8.x.x there was a huge change in coding, hooks and almost every where.

These are the most things I feel WordPress good at. And I love WordPress and their philosophy. Happy coding...
